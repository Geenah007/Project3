# Project_4_29628784
This project is about User Acceptance Testing and implementing RPA(Robotic Process Automation). RPA is the ability to use use human intelligence to perform certain tasks. It is highly beneficial in the sense that it perfoms the menial tasks that people might not have time for, allowing them to focus more on the tasks that require "Common Sense". 

This project will take you through the process of creating a profile, logging in and taking you to the home page where a user can select "Customers", "Orders", "Products",and "Order Details". The user can select "Add", for example, if they have selected "Orders". The Excel sheet that generates a true or false response will display "True" when your Edit, Delete, and Details have successfully been able to Edit an entry, delete an entry and view Details.
